/**
 * Shell geometry as CSS custom properties, for statically rendered web apps.
 *
 * A prerender has no viewport. Every breakpoint hook therefore has to guess,
 * and whatever it guesses is wrong for most readers: the static HTML ships one
 * layout and the client swaps to another on hydration, which costs a full-page
 * layout shift and — where the guess reaches the markup rather than just a
 * number — a hydration mismatch that throws the prerendered tree away.
 *
 * The colors in this library already solved the same problem: they resolve
 * through `var(--plocks-…)` so one `@media` block restyles the static
 * page before any JavaScript runs (see `core/theme/cssVariableTheme.ts`). This
 * is that trick applied to layout. `createAppShellCss` emits the shell's
 * geometry for every breakpoint as media queries; `AppShell cssGeometry` emits
 * `var()` references instead of resolved numbers. The browser then answers the
 * question the prerender could not, at first paint, and the client's first
 * render emits the identical string — so there is nothing to shift and nothing
 * to mismatch.
 *
 * Opt-in per app, because it is a contract: an app that turns `cssGeometry` on
 * must inline the stylesheet this module builds, and the two must be built from
 * the same config. Apps that don't are untouched.
