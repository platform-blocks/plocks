title: Toast
category: feedback
tags: [toast, notification, alert, message, feedback]
playground: true
accessibility: "Every toast is announced when it appears (assertive for error / warning severities, polite otherwise) through the shared announcer, so VoiceOver and web screen readers hear it too — not only Android's live regions. Its accessible name is the title plus the body's text. The close button is labelled 'Close notification' by default; Escape dismisses a toast while focus is inside it, and hover or focus pauses the auto-hide countdown for the whole stack."
props:
  variant: 'light' | 'filled' | 'outline'
  size: Size token — xs | sm | md | lg | xl | 2xl | 3xl (or a number)
  color: Theme color token or custom string
  severity: Severity helper — info | success | warning | error
  title: Toast title rendered above the body
  children: Body content (or use `message` on `useToast` shortcuts)
  icon: Override the leading icon
  withCloseButton: Show a dismiss button
  position: Entry direction — 'top' | 'bottom' | 'left' | 'right' (`ToastDirection`; the provider's screen position type is `ToastStackPosition`)
  autoHide: Auto-hide duration in ms (0 to disable)
  withAutoCloseProgress: Draw a line along the bottom edge that shrinks over `autoHide` and pauses with the countdown (also a `ToastProvider` default)
  paused: Suspend the auto-hide countdown, resuming with the time that was left
  persistent: Keep toast visible until manually dismissed
  onExited: Fired once the hide transition has finished playing
  actions: Action buttons rendered next to the body
  titleProps: Override props applied to the title `<Text>` (style, fw, ff, size, c)
  bodyProps: Override props applied to the body `<Text>` (the children content)
  layout: "`ToastProvider` prop — 'default' | 'stacked'; `stacked` shows only the newest toast with older ones peeking behind it until the stack is hovered or pressed"
